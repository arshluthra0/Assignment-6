          <p>
            His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical
            engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer. Around
            age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and
            acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using a
            manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he
            created called Blastar.

            Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. In
            1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two
            years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. He
            graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and
            a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. He dropped out of Stanford,
            deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet
            startup

          <a href="#">Location</a>
          <p>
            From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California
            where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded and where their
            headquarters are still located. In 2020, Musk moved to Texas.

            Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while
            attending Queen's University, and they married in 2000. Musk
            contracted malaria in 2000 while on vacation in South Africa, and
            almost died. In 2002, their first child, son Nevada Alexander Musk,
            died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.
            After his death, the couple decided to use IVF to continue their
            family. Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in April 2004, followed
            by triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. The couple divorced in
            2008 and share custody of their five sons

        <div class="accordian">
          <a href="#"> Zip2 </a>
          <p>
            In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company
            Zip2 with funds from angel investors. They housed the venture at a
            small rented office in Palo Alto. The company developed and marketed
            an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with
            maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before the
            company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and
            instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the
            YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.

        <div class="accordian">
          <a href="#"> Musk Foundation </a>
          <p>
            Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which states its purpose is
            to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as
            other goals. Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350
            contributions. Around half were to scientific research or education
            nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation,
            his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and Kimball's Big
            Green

        <div class="accordian">
          <a href="#">OpenAI</a>
          <p>
            In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a
            not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming
            to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and
            beneficial to humanity. A particular focus of the company is to
            "counteract large corporations [and governments] who may gain too
            much power by owning super-intelligence systems". In 2018, Musk left
            the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as
            CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through
            Tesla Autopilot.

        <div class="accordian">
          <a href="#">Neuralink</a>
          <p>
            In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup
            company to integrate the human brain with AI. Neuralink's purpose is
            to create devices that are embedded in the human brain to facilitate
            the merging of the brain with machines. The devices will also
            reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial intelligence to
            stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the
            devices to communicate with software more effectively.

          <a href="#">The Boring Company</a>
          <p>
            In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels.[145]
            In early 2017, they began discussions with regulatory bodies and
            initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m)
            long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of
            SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.[146] A tunnel beneath
            the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[147]
            Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel
            system.

            <h3>SpaceX</h3>
            <p>
              In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He
              was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars
              and discussed funding the project himself. In October 2001, Musk
              traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic
              missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into
              space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however,
              Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the
              Russian chief designers. In February 2002, the group returned to
              Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with
              Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk
              rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build
              affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk
              founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in
              May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds
              the title of Chief Engineer.

              After three failed launches, SpaceX succeeded in launching the
              Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first private liquid-fuel rocket to
              reach Earth orbit. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion
              Commercial Resupply Services program contract for 12 flights of
              its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International
              Space Station.

            <h3>Tesla</h3>
            <p>
              Tesla, originally Tesla Motorsâ€”was incorporated in July 2003 by
              Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company
              until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles
              in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.
              Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he
              invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined
              Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role
              within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not
              deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a
              series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial
              crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership
              of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009
              lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla
              co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others

              Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008.
              With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial
              production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.
              Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012 a
              cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015

            <h3>PayPal</h3>
            <p>
              In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and
              e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally
              insured online banks, and, within its initial months, over 200,000
              customers joined the service.[ The company's investors saw Musk as
              inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by
              the end of the year. The following year, X.com merged with online
              bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition. Founded by Max
              Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer
              service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
              Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference
              for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company
              and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues
              and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and
              replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the
              company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in
              2001.

            <p>
              In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of
              which Musk the largest shareholder with 11.7% received over $100
              million. In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for
              an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.
